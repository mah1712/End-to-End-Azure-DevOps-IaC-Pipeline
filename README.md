## 🛠 Prerequisites (Mandatory Setup)

Before running the pipeline, ensure the following are configured in your environment:

### 1. Self-Hosted Build Agent (Required)
- This pipeline is designed to run on a **Self-Hosted Agent** (configured in the `Default` pool).
- Ensure your agent has `Python/Pip`,`tar` and `Curl` installed.
- *Why?* Enterprise environments use self-hosted agents for security and to keep traffic within a private network.

### 2. Azure Backend State
You must manually create the following resources to store the Terraform `.tfstate` file:
- **Resource Group**: e.g., `rg-terraform-mgmt`
- **Storage Account**: e.g., `stterraformstate001`
- **Container**: `tfstate`
- Update the `backend*` variables in `azure-pipelines.yml` with your specific names.

### 3. Azure DevOps Configuration
- **Service Connection**: Create an ARM Service Connection named **`Azure-Service-Connection`**.
- **Identity Management**: Create or identify an **Azure Service Principal**.
- **Access Control (IAM)**: 
    *   **Subscription Level**: Assign the `Contributor` or `Owner` role.
    *   **Storage Account Level**: Assign the **`Storage Blob Data Contributor`** role (Required for Terraform state management).
- **Infracost API Key**: Sign up at Infracost.io and add the key as a secret variable named **`INFRACOST_API_KEY`** in your pipeline.

## 🚀 How to Use this Repository

1.  **Fork** this repository to your GitHub account.
2.  **Import** the Forked Repo into your **Azure DevOps Project**.
3.  Update the **variables** in `/pipelines/azure-pipelines.yml` to match your Azure backend details.
4.  Create a **New Pipeline** pointing to the existing YAML file: `/pipelines/azure-pipelines.yml`.
5.  **Run Pipeline!**

## 🛡 The Pipeline Workflow (Step-by-Step)
`Init` ➔ `Fmt` ➔ `Validate` ➔ `Security Scan (TFSec/Checkov)` ➔ `Plan` ➔ `Compliance Check (Terrascan)` ➔ `Cost Estimate (Infracost)` ➔ `Manual Approval` ➔ `Apply`
